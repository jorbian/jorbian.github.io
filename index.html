										<h2>ABOUT</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am a computer programmer, a philologist, Lusophile, and a free thinker. I became a developer not because I like starring at a computer screen but because I want to think of solutions that nobody else thought of before.<br /><br />
									I love solving problems. I love being able to look at a solution and know what I did to make it happen. I would be happy, probably, doing anything where I can have that kind of feedback to what I do, but being a dev lets you solve problems in some of the most interesting and unique ways imaginable. You can't solve every problem with software but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. The more difficult or unexpected path to the mountain top the more satisfying it is when you can finally get to look down and enjoy the view. The harder it is to figure something out the more satisfying it is when you finally DO get the solution you were looking for.</p>

												<h4>Techlahoma Foundation Data Collection Tool.</h4>
												<p>Created simple web app for use by the Techlahoma Foundation to track attendance at meetings of various local user groups across the state of Oklahoma.
Leveraged existing knowledge of Python to guide team members towards the most ‘Pythonic’ solution to various problems that came up.
Took point on application deployment on Pythonanywhere.com.

												<h4>FLIGHT OF THE DODO</h4>
												<p>One of the few projects I got to work on at Holberton that I am genuinely proud of was this simple game. I got to work with the great Vishal Gobin, who is originally from Mauritius, and was able to create a unique asthetic to complement my design mechanics, complete with an introduction to Sega, a type of Indo-African dance music which helped tie everything together beautifully. He was also able to use his previous experiene in the business world to help introduce me to new and better concepts of project management based on Agile. I am only sorry we were working on such a tight deadline and couldn't realize the game's full potential.</p>
